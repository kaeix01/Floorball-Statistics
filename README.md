## Analysis
> ðŸš§: You can reuse the analysis (you made) from other projects (e.g., requirement engineering), but it must be submitted according to the following template. 

### Scenario

Floorball-Statistics project is about displaying information and stats (data) about the three highest floorball leagues in Switzerland. Main goal of our website will be to display all the relevant stats of teams and players, which are needed for teams to prepare for their upcoming games. 

### User Stories


### Use Case

## Design
> ðŸš§: Keep in mind the Corporate Identity (CI); you shall decide appropriately the color schema, graphics, typography, layout, User Experience (UX), and so on.

### Wireframe
> ðŸš§: It is suggested to start with a wireframe. The wireframe focuses on the website structure (Sitemap planning), sketching the pages using Wireframe components (e.g., header, menu, footer) and UX. You can create a wireframe already with draw.io or similar tools.

### Prototype
> ðŸš§: A prototype can be designed using placeholder text/figures in Budibase. You don't need to connect the front-end to back-end in the early stages of the project development.

### Domain Design
> ðŸš§: Provide a picture and describe your domain model; you may use Entity-Relationship Model or UML class diagram. Both can be created in Visual Paradigm - we have an academic license for it.

### Business Logic 
> ðŸš§: Describe the business logic for **at least one business service** in detail. If available, show the expected path and HTPP method. The remaining documentation of APIs shall be made available in the swagger endpoint. The default Swagger UI page is available at /swagger-ui.html.

**Path**:

**Param**:

**Method:**

## Implementation
> ðŸš§: Briefly describe your technology stack, which apps were used and for what.

### Backend Technology
> ðŸš§: It is suggested to clone this repository, but you are free to start from fresh with a Spring Initializr. If so, describe if there are any changes to the PizzaRP e.g., different dependencies, versions & etc... Please, also describe how your database is set up. If you want a persistent or in-memory H2 database check [link](https://github.com/FHNW-INT/Pizzeria_Reference_Project/blob/main/pizza/src/main/resources/application.properties). If you have placeholder data to initialize at the app, you may use a variation of the method **initPlaceholderData()** available at [link](https://github.com/FHNW-INT/Pizzeria_Reference_Project/blob/main/pizza/src/main/java/ch/fhnw/pizza/PizzaApplication.java).

### Frontend Technology
> ðŸš§: Describe your views and what APIs is used on which view. If you don't have access to the Internet Technology class Budibase environment(https://inttech.budibase.app/), please write to Devid on MS teams.



## Execution
> ðŸš§: Please describe how to execute your app and what configurations must be changed to run it. 


> ðŸš§: This is a shortened description for example purposes. A complete tutorial will be provided in a dedicated lecture.


### Deployment to a PaaS
> ðŸš§: Deployment to PaaS is optional but recommended as it will make your application (backend) accessible without server restart and through a unique, constantly available link.  

## Project Management
> ðŸš§: Include all the participants and briefly describe each of their **individual** contribution and/or roles. Screenshots/descriptions of your Kanban board or similar project management tools are welcome.
